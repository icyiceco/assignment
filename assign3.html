        <br>For those who love online shopping, an indispensable service for living in Hong Kong is the express consolidation and forwarding service. The process of mailing multiple parcels to an international express consolidation company warehouse and then the consolidation company packs the express parcels together for you and mails them overseas is called express consolidation and forwarding (快递集运服务).
        </br>
        <br>Before making an e-commerce purchase, a user needs to determine which express consolidation company s/he chooses, because the address for the purchase needs to be filled in with the address of the company's consolidation warehouse. In turn, choosing a service provider requires comparing information such as timeliness, price, self-pickup points, etc.
        </br>
        <br>For new users of express consolidation and forwarding services, the sheer volume of choices and unintegrated information can make one dizzy in choosing the right forwarding service provider for them, given that there are more than two dozen companies offering services in the market today. Users need to find information on different platforms, which is often incomplete and inconsistent, and this process is perceived as energy-intensive and time-consuming. In addition, it is often difficult for users to distinguish between promotional posts for transit services on social media and genuine shared posts.
        </br>
        <br>The project provides a solution toward the problem. You can find out more about this topic <a href="https://hkdesign.org/be-creative-be-realistic/">here</a>.<br>
